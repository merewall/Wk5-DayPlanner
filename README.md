# Wk5-DayPlanner
Modifying starter code to create a simple day planner application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day
## Description
This project was completed after learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web APIs, and Third Party APIs. The task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying the starter code. The app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This assignment was meant to use the newly learned concepts of jQuery elements, jQuery click events, jQuery form elements, jQuery DOM Traversal, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and the Moment.js library/format.

The following acceptance criteria were used in the development of this web application:

* When the user opens the day planner application, the current day is displayed at the top of the planner
* When the user scrolls down the planner, they are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
* When the user views the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicated whether it is in the past, present, or future
* When the user clicks into a timeblock, they can enter an event
* When the user clicks the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved to local storage (and displayed on the page)
* When the user refreshes the page, the saved events still display on the page
